[Description]
This study aims to compare the safety of tofacitinib with adalimumab and etanercept in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). We will replicate the design and population inclusion criteria of an ongoing phase 3b/4 randomized clinical trial (NCT02092467), with the aim of predicting the RCT results using real-world evidence. In this study, we will analyze data from observational databases across the OHDSI network using the OHDSI CohortMethod package framework to perform this comparative study.
