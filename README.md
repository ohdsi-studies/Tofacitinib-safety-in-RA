**About This Study:**
On May 2-3, 2018, a group of OHDSI community investigators converged on Columbia University to design and execute a Population-Level Estimation study in 2 days. The result was a diverse group of experts ranging from clinicians, biostatisticians, epidemilogists, data analysts, software engineers and other observational health data enthusiasts. A presentation on the innovative community-led process to rapidly iterate on a study question is explored more in this [2018 OHDSI US Symposium Lighting Talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybKFFAP5Gl0) and [Slides](https://www.ohdsi.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/OHDSI-LightningTalk2018-FeeneyKostka.pdf). The community-driven process for choosing a question is detailed in the [OHDSI Forums](https://forums.ohdsi.org/t/ohdsi-face-to-face-at-columbia-may2-3-community-study-a-thon/4008). In just two days, the OHDSI community generated a fully specified protocol and executed a study package on multiple data sets.

This repository serves to document the iterative improvements made to initial study designed as well as the publication and dissemination of results for the broader scientific community. 

**Description:**
This study aims to compare the safety of tofacitinib with adalimumab and etanercept in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). We will replicate the design and population inclusion criteria of an ongoing phase 3b/4 randomized clinical trial (NCT02092467), with the aim of predicting the RCT results using real-world evidence. In this study, we will analyze data from observational databases across the OHDSI network using the OHDSI CohortMethod package framework to perform this comparative study.
